# AngularDBQueries

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

For changing URI edit the file src/app/utils/urls.ts

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Running tslint

Run `ng lint` to execute the codechecks (provided from angular) defined in .angular-cli.json and tslint.json

The folder /src/app/utils/data-table/ is not excluded so it will show lint errors.
